# AmericanCollegeGrads

With this dataset, I explored job outcomes of Americans who graduated college between 2010 and 2012 using pandas and matplotlib visualization techniques.  This data comes from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a> via <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors">FiveThirtyEight</a>.
